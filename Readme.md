This django playground repository showcases my familiarity with django framework
and mu abilities to lavarage the bleuprints i need for my own projects.
for this example i decided to create a data base tha collects data on vehicle activities using the number plate as PK
while brainstorming on this i chose thses three delevarables to satisfy stakeholders expectation.

* log car transactions based on service type
* find relationships between accident reports and mechanical failures
* log insurance claim data(pull from existing sets from insurance assuming is (csv))
* relaising the use of paperforms i decided to digitise existing forms for easy engestion of data (here we set up validation rules)
